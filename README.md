### Pak Choi with Ginger and Seitan

-  quite some Pak Choi

-  a thumb of Ginger

-  enough Seitan

-  Coconut oil

-  Ginger oil

-  a little Garlic

-  a few dashes of soy sauce

-  a wok with a lid

Wash and cut everything to size and comfortable degree of cleanliness.
Fry the garlic and ginger and seitan a little bit before adding the pak choi to the wok. It's cool if there is still a little water on the leaves so that it steams up nicely. Add a little bit of soy sauce just to cut the frying oil down. Maybe also a little bit of ginger oil.
put the lid on and let cook for a couple minutes until the pak choi is done.
